## Project Structure
login-form/
│
├── index.html        # Main HTML file (Login form structure)
├── style.css         # CSS file (Styling and layout)
├── paint.jpg         # Background image (replaceable)
└── README.md         # Project documentation

## How to Use

Download this repository.

Make sure the index.html and style.css files are in the same folder.

Open index.html in your browser to view the login form.

Optionally, replace the background image (paint.jpg) with your own.

## Customization

To change the background image, replace paint.jpg with your preferred image and update the CSS:

background: url('your-image.jpg') no-repeat;


To change the font, edit the Google Fonts import line in style.css.

You can adjust the button color, border radius, or blur intensity by editing values in .btn and .wrapper.

## Note

This login page is for design and demonstration purposes only — it does not connect to a real authentication backend. To make it functional, you can integrate it with JavaScript, Node.js, PHP, or any server-side technology later.
